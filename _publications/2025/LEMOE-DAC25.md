  Designing processor microarchitectures is increasingly challenging due to a vast design space and the need to balance multiple metrics. Traditional algorithm-driven design space exploration (DSE) approaches often struggle to incorporate the extensive domain knowledge of expert architects. To address this, we introduce LEMOE, a multi-objective microarchitecture optimization framework that leverages large language model (LLM) to enhance an implicit Bayesian model. LEMOE features a program-aware warm-up phase utilizing LLM and LLVM to produce an initial design set with rich prior knowledge. By harnessing LLMâ€™s contextual learning, our approach improves surrogate modeling and sampling under sparse data conditions. Experiment results show that LEMOE achieves a $22.8 \%$ improvement in energy efficiency with the same number of iterations and a $2.9 \times$ runtime speedup for the same target compared to prior works.
