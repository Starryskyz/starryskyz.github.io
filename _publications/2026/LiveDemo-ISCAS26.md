abstract: >-
  As the demand for efficient and flexible acceleration grows in AI and embedded domains, Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Array (CGRA) have emerged as a promising architecture that balances performance and reconfigurability. This demo presents an agile CGRA system implemented as an FPGA overlay, together with a fully automated toolchain that compiles high-level inputs into executable binaries. Visitors will experience end-to-end deployment of AI models and high-performance computing kernels on a CGRA-overlayed Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC platform, demonstrating the system’s efficiency, flexibility, and debugging capability.
